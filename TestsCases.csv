1. Set the device to es_US (or any other locale, including en_US, but preferably non-en_US in order to utilize the setup for localization validations) > open the Messaging application.
2. Compose a New text message and use non-ASCII characters ( ""Start£ ~ • € ™ Ÿ¡¢ ¤ ¥ ¦ § ¨© Çëlìñą, FR:éçëïüÿâêîôûàèù, IT:àèéìíîòóùú DE:ÄÖüß, ES: ñáéíóúüï¡¿, PT:üÁÂÃÀÇÉÊÍÓÔÕÚ, CS: áéíóúýčďěňřšťůž, PL: óąćęłńśźż, GR:ΐέΑΩΦΘΓβαλάή, RS:МарияЭёыю KO:가-힣_ZH:丁 七 丈_JP: えぉおか, 张成,周書語,BiDi: يל ڜظ ,end."").

2. Verify at the recipient' side the message is displayed without data corruption and appears in readable format (the text sent matches the text received).  

(Note: Due to a carrier requirement, some LatAm and EMEA carriers are converting all non-ASCII characters to utf-7 and as a result such characters from the original message will appear omitted or will be converted to plain ASCII in the received message. In ST6 the Messaging app has setting for 16bit and 7bit encoding (default) for products outside of US, SpyderUMTS)
