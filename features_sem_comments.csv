FEATURE-3934,"This feature is requesting to take in consideration special characters during contacts search for the dialed matching comparison.

Currently, AOSP disregards special characters, such as ""*"" and ""#"" during stock contacts search. 

The stock contacts search disregards special characters and uses normalized numbers with limit on how many digits are used for comparison.

This stock behavior has caused issues and complains by LATAM Carriers, based on the fact that they have some services stored as SDN (Service Dialed Numbers) in Contacts db which dial number uses special character, and causing matching issues.

For example, if a SDN stored as ""Service1"", number ""*100"", either if a user dials ""100"", it will match with Contact record ""Service1"" and display it in the phone app.
