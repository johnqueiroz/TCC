New internet panel implemented in SystemUI app for R2 products onward:
!systemui-internet-panel-001.png|width=240! !systemui-internet-panel-002.png|width=240!

I've talked to [~roseane] and [~caioluiz] about this change in Google AOSP. 
Please, reach me out anytime when implementing this feature in SystemUI app.
+[~dvx436]/ [~gabrieln]
This feature was moved to SystemUI app: RPADX-6322.
This feature was recently impacted by a change in Google AOSP.  The initial implementation was done in Settings but with the AOSP changes a rework is needed in System UI.
This is an MS2 exception as their is new work being covered by RPADX-6010 this depends on.
We need to maintain both feature versions in Settings and SystemUI apps: RPADX-6010
[~dvx436] please commit to this plan.
[~roseane], I've just checked some code in SystemUI app:
https://sse.am.mot.com/s_source/xref/ms-r-qmsi_all/frameworks/base/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/qs/tiles/dialog/InternetDialog.java
https://sse.am.mot.com/s_source/xref/ms-r-qmsi_all/frameworks/base/packages/SystemUI/res/layout/internet_connectivity_dialog.xml

The code implemented by Google in Settings app was a little restricted and we couldn't make some changes requested by CxD team, but it seems in SystemUI app there isn't any restriction/difficulty regarding UI/UX requests. We probably can have a better version of this feature now.
[~roseane], [~rafaelml] are you able to commit to this plan?
[~wangyl17] can you please commit to this plan?
[~wangyl17] the CR linked to this plan has been closed?  Has the feature been integrated?  If yes can you please update the Integrate Actual date on the plan?

h3. *Clarifications From Dev Team*
 * Are the changes just visual on the Internet Slice (in relation to the actual solution for Android S)?
 * Is there any impact on the Internet screen within Settings?

 * Should both SIMs be listed in the Internet Slice?
 * When clicking ""Done"" should the notifications curtain continue to be displayed or should it be closed?

Changing Integrate CWV, as we will need more time to review all the gerrits.
Currently, PAKS app is not working because Checkin is not happening and the device ID is not generated. We checked that _DeviceManagement_ component is not included in the S build and also checked with [~a14614] (his team maintains ccc components) and they are still working on Checkin due to some permission restrictions in Android S. They are expecting to push our changes by 27 July. So we are changing *_Integrate CWV_* to 30/Jul/21 because the PAKS depends on the device ID to work correctly which is generated during Checkin.

Satish, Moto team 
We are compliant  with IMS 1.2.6 requirement with FR 53361 and CR 2461536.
 
 
 
IMS 1.2.6	The device must do a silent redial on 1x for first-time SIP INVITE when it receives either no response within 12 seconds or a SIP response with an error code 380, 4xx (with the exception of 408,422,423,433,486,487), 5xx, and 6xx (with the exception of 603) during VoLTE voice call origination. After completion of 1x voice call, device must do a SIP REGISTER with the IMS network. 

The 12 second timer must apply to first-time SIP INVITE only, and this must be different than Timer B.	01/10/19	Mandatory	Production
Coming to Vo-WI-FI requirements on v19.1.0 these are marked for future delivery. Currently this is under review and we will share an update once review is completed. We will try our best to revert back by Friday , if any changes I will let you know.
Many Thanks

1. Code review is completed and the source code is integrated (https://gerrit.mot.com/#/c/1878202/)
2. For this feature to be officially available in the borneo R builds there are 2 dependencies.
* VoWiFi certification from NOKIA has to be done for which the activity is currently under progress.
* Since this app will be added as binary apk, the LCCARPLOAD-1225 should be approved and the review is in progress.

3. Currently NOKIA server has issues, once resolved I can share device with SIM with my own build which contains the apk for testing.
* Please note this feature can only be tested on a particular borneo device with IMEI id 356891110030188  and a USCC Lab SIM with IMSI = 311225800003181.
Adding [~a19035],

Yes, we would like to move this feature to next NPI on Q4 2020.
After further discussions USC will use R2 as its baseline.  Thus removing the A12 R1 Need label.
Agree!
Applied the a12r1 label at creation when it should have been a12r0.  Fixing it.
As per Arthur latest comment on the CR # IKSWR-72560

However, according to Noel's comment and this spreadsheet (2021NA config), Borneo Retail does not support WFC on USC.

Need to wait for the Target device to validate this functionality.

[~wcw014][~a22642] - FYI
As per Mayank on 17-Nov-2020:
Lets keep FEATURE-6192 and add delta from FEATURE-6967 to that.
USC has ranged Borneo and they will need WFC on the same during R upgrade.

17-Nov-2020: Noel shipped USC Test SIMs to India

As per the Android R upgrade [plan|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TPO_iwj1OeXh06zsFlUPo3MkrxbbrqTd-zXZZ-U19Os/edit#gid=145684658], the R MS1 complete for BORNEO is planned for 2/5/21.

For the feature development work *to start* we need the following *dependency* as well to be resolved.
* We need to use the NOKIA IOT lab server and we are waiting on the PO of certificate to be complete. 
* We are waiting for more info from USC carrier on when their production network will be ready for functional test. 
As there are no USC upgrades or NPI launches planned for A12 R0 or A12 R0, moving this plan to A12 R2.
As there is no core apps custom work I am dropping this plan.

[~dth436] / [~clao] FYI
As this wasn't implemented for P I am going to move the plan to Q NPIs.
Austin has been ranged by USC and these features are now needed to be included in A12 R1 so adding the A12 R1 Need label.
Based on Modem team's comment in CR https://idart.mot.com/browse/IKSWQ-3236, modem will not support USCC VoWiFi for Sofia/Gin.

This is only considered to support Racer_5G which is still in discussion with QCOM.  FW will not enable it so far until modem get clear information from QCOM
Current plan doesn't meet the Sofia FC date so adding the risk label.
Currently USCC network is not yet ready and their requirement is still defined .
They will have more details to clarify the requirement in upcoming weeks.   USCC has told us that they are planning update the requirement for additional details.
Development is completed and tested with the NOKIA Lab Server with USCC Lab Sim.
*Code review* is in progress :
* https://gerrit.mot.com/#/c/1878202/ (source)
* https://gerrit.mot.com/#/c/1878200/ (binary)
* https://gerrit.mot.com/#/c/1879477/ (USC product make file)

During a review of current plan backlogs in preperation for 2021 Q2 RQL it was determined this plan could move to Q3 or beyond.
For test build, FW don't need to do the IMS configuration. Tester can enable VoWiFi via hidden menu. Hold this feature plan until it is planned for the product.
From the requirement https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CnkNUxphIdOKVK2nSKvsO1eoUrp5yWQauxY9CFDD5qc/edit?ts=5fda3676#gid=54230312, only one UI mentioned for VoWiFi

{noformat}
The device must allow the user to enable and disable Voice over Wi-Fi and other Wi-Fi features from the device settings.
{noformat}

Keep other parameters as AOSP default value.
Gin has been renamed to Fiji
Hi Kumar,
Yes, I have been communicated to her and the team. 
I believe she is working with her team now.
Hi Kumar,  will you be willing to help us to generate a test build?
Does the current baseline already have VoWiFi functionalities and just need the App team to support?

I just want to know when we can get a test build to USC so that can verify on their network for VoWiFi calling.
Hi [~kmjd67],
The test cases are available on: [link|https://dalek.mot.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20CCTEST%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20%22Test%20Case%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20New%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22USC_6192_VoWiFi_calling%20%22%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20cc_fid_6192]
Only need the SME approval and test plan creation.
[~fvmk68] FYI,
I can't access QCOM SR 04118875, need [~a20454] help comment.
Integration not done and no product to test.
It is possible for [~a24148] to complete the development testing using the current TS.43 certification purchased from Nokia.

Additional MotiveSmart license if needed only for IOT testing in Nokia labs
No Target/Reference Product Identified.
Nokia IoT Testing in Progress. Once Done, USCC needs to approve in the Production Server. 

After Approval, we need to test the End to End testing of WFC functionality.
Per IKSWQ-3236, QCOM has planned to support this feature and lack of ETA.

FW will commit to enable USCC WFC assuming QCOM modem support it. This feature is only valid on Sofia for FW feature plan commit.
Per agreement with [~a19035] and at the request of [~dth436] and [~w19976] moving this to Q1 2021 (R)

[~wch683] FYI
Per discussion at the 2021Q1 RQL meeting today it was agreed this should be moved to 2021Q2.

FEATURE-6192: {color:#326ca6}USCC:< VoWiFi calling for NPI>{color} on Release: 
RPADX-1939 ADX P_Pure+_Rel1
Removing 2H2019 labels from Racer 5G and adding 1H2020
Removing Sofia and Gin labels as [~clao] has communicated in FEATURE-6192 that these have been negotiated out of scope for these products.
Thanks. Then I will hold this feature development until the requirement is updated.

Put ""Integrate CWV"" as 06/01 temporarily.
The PO order has been approved for VoWifi certification to access the NOKIA IOT lab. In addition to this NOKIA/USC has informed to purchase the *MotiveSmart license* worth $10k as well *which is still pending*. Waiting on the approval for the MotiveSmart license PO approval now. 
The TS.43 implementation to support the VoWifi calling solution is now added by Google in Android S.

So, as part of this plan following actions needs to be done.
 * Check whether Google solution covers all the USC Wfc usecases.
 * Will need to re-run the IOT cases with NOKIA with Google solution.

cc: [~dth436]
There is no conclusion with USC. 
[~wcw014]: / [~a19035] / [~wch683]: Pls move this feature to Q2-2021.
* Will still continue technical discussions with USC.
This is needed for Sofia so adding Sofia label.
This is not needed until 2020 NPIs however USC is requesting a test build on Oslo_M.  [~clao] to provide timeline for this request.
This plan is expected to be in base for the 2020 Q3 ADX release.  As such marking plans expected to be in base with 2020Q2 label for easier tracking.
USC Network Team and Motorola Modem Team are working on this issue along with QC. Expecting the Resolution ASAP.
USC team confirmed that the development *cannot be done on their live network*. We should use the *NOKIA IOT lab server for the feature development*. 
The development activity *has been blocked on the PO for accessing the NOKIA IOT lab*. Once the PO is done, will start on the feature development.

Also, we need to use the *Borneo device with R build for the development* . The bring up of R on borneo is in progress and the *target date for MS1 complete is 2/5*
USC team shared the production server details. I tried to connect to the production server using SofiaP device with USC sim, the GET method succeeded and got the aka challenge request, after the device processs the aka challenge and responds back with POST method, the USC server responded back with *500 Internal Server error*.

Have emailed the USC team to help on this. Waiting for the response.
Update Integrate CWV date
Update the integration date 2021/2/3
Update the integration date to 2021/2/15 as it is moved to 2021 Q2
Updating the labels to remove Sofia and add Gin.  Sofia/Sofia+ are low probability for ranging by USC where Gin is high probability.
Updating to R1 as there are no USC upgrades off of R0 and no products are available for testing.
VoWiFi requirements for USCC are generic in nature and should be supported by default.

App side responsibilities include:
1. Enable / Disable VoWiFi device settings based on IMS Management Object parameter
2. User ability to turn on / off VoWiFi settings
3. Roaming preference setting

*The above mentioned requirements are not mandatory to validate ePDG functionality.*

There are no requirements for Emergency Address Management in attached USCC requirements doc.

[~wcw014] / [~clao]: Pls drop this RPADX for App. I would like to avoid unnecessary tracking of the Planning CR that is not scoped for now.
We are still pending the information from USCC.

But currently we have proposed to USCC to defer VoWiFi to 2021 products.

[~a19035] Pls help clarify which target product need this feature, and help share the latest requirement spec. Thanks.

Move the date to 09/01 temporarily.
[~a20454] Any update from QC on this?

[~w19976] Mahmoud is pressuring us to have all features for Sofia committed by next Wed.  Please commit if possible.  ADX feature complete for Sofia is 10/30.  Remember we will need time for testing and bug fixes.
[~a20454] Any update on schedule from QC?  [~w19976] Assume we need to wait for QC response before committing? 
[~a20454] is still checking with QCOM if they can support USCC VoWiFi with CR IKSWQ-3236.  Once it is clear, I will commit this feature based on QCOM's time line.
[~a24148], [~dth436] the Int CWV date for this plan is past due.  Please help to update it.  As you know we want to get this into mainline so that we can test and get it propagated to Q2 all before 3/12.

USCC will do the provision via standard VoWiFI, they will provide us the link to point to enter the emergency service location.
{noformat}

I understand USCC would like to do WFC entitlement check with the emergency address link, could you help comment what is the detailed link address? Also in the old requirement, USCC ever mentioned below, may I understand it will be shown by USCC's web site after the link is launched?
{noformat}
The device must display U.S. Cellular’s Terms and Conditions to the customer as related to Voice calling over Wi-Fi.
{noformat}

In the old spec, it also mentioned below, as OMADM for VoWiFi not supported, do they have any update for those related requirements?
{noformat}
The device must show all VoLTE  and VoWiFi user interface controls and settings when the 3GPP IMS Management Object parameter Voice_Domain_Preference_E_UTRAN dictates that VoLTE functionality is enabled from the network.
The device must allow the user to enable and disable Voice over W-Fi and other Wi-Fi features from the device settings when the 3GPP IMS Management Object parameter Media_Type_Restriction_Policy is set to enable Wireless Local Access Network (WLAN).
The device must hide all Voice over Wi-Fi device settings when the 3GPP IMS Management Object parameter Media_Type_Restriction_Policy is set to disable Voice over Wi-Fi.
{noformat}
[~clao] Have the requirements been clarified?  Can we get an ETA from them?
[~clao]: Please request Ming-shu for the test builds, as VoWiFi needs to be enabled in FW
[~dth436] Borneo R upgrade should pick up Q3-2021 and hence the decision to move it there. 
We should still keep working on our development so that we can discuss any issues. 
[~dth436] There is an item from USCC VoWiFi requirement - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U36s4KUyYExC6gEtD2GucjkY4i6z7zNqjWH5kra31Gk/edit#gid=1868168186

[~dth436] we had dropped this Core Apps Custom plan for this feature as previously you had thought there was no work for it.  I have reopened the plan for you to use and moved it to Q1.

[~w19976] FYI
[~dth436], [~a24148] I believe the certification results came in early but there was one issue identified.  Can you clarify if that has been resolved and if we can get this feature integrated now?

[~tgb348], [~a22642], [~w15621] FYI
[~karinyo]: Did we develop the test cases for this feature?
[~fvmk68]: FYI
[~tgb348] USC WFC is not enabled yet for any product. As I mentioned before, I need PdM team help clarify with target product and latest requriement spec. 

Pls help verify it after the code is integrated.

[~w19976] / [~a20454] Do we have an update from QC yet on IKSWQ-3236?  Ming-Shu can you commit yet?
[~w19976] / [~a20454] I am still waiting for an update...
[~w19976] ADX FC is 10/30 for Sofia.  We need to improve the integration date.  Can we get prioritization with QC?

[~kmjd67] FYI we will need to pull in the test dates as well.
[~w19976] Are you able to commit to this?  It has the Sofia label.  We are to be FC for Sofia by 10/30.  Will need time for testing and bug fixing built into that.
[~w19976] If this is integrated can you update the Int Actual date.  If it is not can you update the Int CWV date?
[~w19976] can you update the target date for this plan please?

[~wcw014],

The NOKIA IOT testing is completed and the *VoWifi certification is approved by USCC*. All the changes related to this Feature has been integrated in the *mainline* and *Q2* branch. Testing can now officially start. [Q2-build_link|https://artifacts.mot.com/artifactory/continuous_builds/borneo/RZB31.Q2_borneo-retail_userdebug_mr-2021-q2_r-qsm2020_test-keys_continuous/92/]

Please note that there *is a dependency on Modem* to set the *WfcProvisioned to true by default* which isn't working on the USCC Lab SIM.  [~tnikhila] is checking if this issue is *reproducible on live SIM as well*. So, before starting the test, ensure that the *WfcProvisioned is set to true* by going to the hidden menu option.

Steps to check if WfcProvisioned is set or not.
1. From Dialer launch the hidden menu option by dialing **#***#4636#***#** 
2. Go to Ims Setting > Wi-Fi Calling and check WfcProvisioned value.
3. If WfcProvisioned is false, then *toggle the Wi-Fi Calling button once and check the WfcProvisioned* value changes to true.
4. Now the device is ready for the test.

*Please note, the above steps needs to executed on every device reboot.*

[~wcw014]: Feature got integrated on 2/19.
* However, the APK cannot be included in official builds till Nokia's certification is complete
** This is as per USC's direction.
** Not allowed to start WFC testing on live network till Nokia certifies.

* Nokia certification process is in progress, ETA: 15-Mar

Hi Noel / Mayank,

As you notice, USCC takes about a month to respond to any query posted by Motorola.
-- It is very difficult to prioritize USCC development, given their response times.
-- With no information about availability of Lab / Production networks, it is not possible to commit VoWifi for USC
-- Minimum needed for commitment for Q1-2021 Upper Platform
21-Aug-2020: USC shall respond back with requested details
During dev phase: Respond to any technical queries / support within 2 days of raising the same.
If the above cannot be assured, pls drop the feature from Q1-2021

FEATURE-6493,,FEATURE-6493: Support Device Lock using 3rd Party solution from PayJoy,"According to [~wjm097]'s comments, this Payjoy feature is only applicable to Saipan in Q2. We need to do configuration per product in addition to configuration based on Channel ID. After discussion together with CM, [~a18268] will need to rework on the configuration. So, I updated the integration date CWV to Feb 5.
As decided with [~wjm097], [~a18268], [~wcw014] and [~brunoess], the feature is going to be integrated to Tahoe on Mainline / Userdebug for us to test it and complete the RPADX.

Before, the feature was mistakingly integrated to Hanoi+ on Q1 stable line, however this is a Q2 feature, that's why we need another product on mainline for Q2 testing.
Code is ready, but pending on the launchcal CR LCCARPLOAD-1187 approval to merge
Feature test executed on Tahoe Mainline

Tests to be executed on Saipan when HW is available with Q2 Common Stable Line build
Given the current status with GTM and after discussion with [~wjm097] it has been agreed to move this to Q1 for consideration.
Hi [~a18268]
Can you please update Integrate CWV?
Hi all, 

According to [~wjm097], this feature will be available only for Saipan in Q2, since we are expecting to receive this device in our site only on Apr/01, I’m updating the Test CWV date of this feature.

Best Regards,
Brunna Arruda
Not sure who put the dates 10/31 here, we even could not start this feature because
1. we did not receive the R deliverables from Payjoy yet.
2. This need Google approval, and we did not receive it yet.

Please contacts with [~w15621] or [~wjm097]] for details
Per discussion with [~w15621] and [~wjm097] moving this to Q2.

RPADX-4189 Plan Created For: 
FEATURE-6493:Support Device Lock using 3rd Party solution from PayJoy on Release:
RPADX-4178:ADX R_Rel1
Required updated Integ date for providing Test CWV.
Reviewed with Mayank and Ajit and this is needed for Q1.
Since [~wjm097] suggest we build this on Capri+ for Q2, so currently it is only picked up for Capri+ user debug build.
If you need, we can raise another commit to enable it for Capri build, not sure if there is any concern there, let me know if need that for Capri.

Steps to test this feature

*Preparation:*
1. Apply the payjoy test account, you can send me email so that I can add you to the test group. After you get the account, login to https://payjoy.com/dashboard/#/, then go to https://payjoy.com/dashboard/#/update-device-manager, scroll down to the section *API Settings:*, copy the *api key* in the below box.
2. Write down the phone's *IMEI*
3. FDR the device, and then flash the test SW. 
4. currently, this feature is only enabled for the channel *openmx*, so if the channel is not openmx, it will not have this feature. Check your phone's channel, if it is not, on a NS device, you can use the command to change it to openmx in *fastboot mode*
fastboot oem config carrier openmx

After this command, use below command to make sure it is indeed set
fastboot oem config carrier.

Also after phone is power up, you can check the channel by
adb shell getprop ro.carrier

*Testing Step*
1. After flash the SW, before it is powered up, activate the payjoy on this device by below link. replace the *<IMEI>* and *<api-key>* with the actual one you got on above steps
   https://api.payjoy.com/devicemanager/v1/device/claim?imei=<imei>&key=<api-key>
2. Power up your device, and go through the set up steps, and connect to internet
3. wait the payjoy app starts, and follow the screen instructions. 
4. When the payjoy app compete the activation, there will be a code on the payjoy screen, something like ""DZQGGXB"" record this code, it is the device tag.
5. Go to https://payjoy.com/dashboard/#/use-device-api, and input the tag in above step in the box, and hit the *Enter* button
6. in the next screen, you can now set the expire date for the device, or deactivate the device, or remove the lock.


The Payjoy release includes the change in 1) Bootable (kernel) 2) Frameworks 3) Application 4) makefile.  FW may take care of 2), 3) and 4), but 1) should be supported by Kernel.
This is considered a first priority for 2021 Q1.
We are still waiting for the new deliverable from Payjoy.  We ever integrated the old Payjoy packages received on early July on Voyager, and it worked fine, but Motorola had further comments on this package, and Payjoy need update the packages based on Motorola comments. For details see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LbgBdxKO0OArX_cbhesesFNOJXjvmFSkRp04b3DFRXA/edit#gid=1839454929.

We have pushed Payjoy to give the expected date for the new package, but we did not get a commitment yet.
Why can's the [plan and test be completed ona refernce device? this is how this feature has been tested so far. Then plan can be closed and once Saipan HW is available it would just need to be retested on it.

Thanks
[~renano], [~a22642] please see Louis comments asking why this can't be completed on a reference device.  Would be nice to not have this hanging open until April if possible.
[~w0126c] Are there dependencies on this plan?  Are you able to commit to it?

[~w15621] FYI
[~w0126c] and [~a18268] this plan is now past due.  Can you update the CWV date please?  Remember feature complete is this Friday 7/31.
[~wcw014]: Based on comments by Yong Jiang, team would be testing on Capri/Capri+ builds. Test dates have been pulled in. "

We are changing the _*integrate CWV date*_ to *2/Jul/21* due to IKSWSRVC-24152 which blocks the integration for the MotoLiveWapaper3 project on Android S because playstore.xml is not yet included by the base root manifest and the project is not included in the build system.

FEATURE-6645,,FEATURE-6645: USCC:<VoLTE cannot be disable on 5G device> Q2 2020,"+[~w19976][~a17364][~a20402][~dvx436]
Reqs -
On the 5G device, the user cannot allow to disable VoLTE.
a) Enable VoLTE out of box.
b) Ignore the OMADM value for VoLTE node
c) Add Pop-up if the user tries to toggle VoLTE off (Enhanced Calling)
“Turning off Enhanced Calling will also turn off 5G mobile data.""

I would understand a) and b) is met by default, and the new work is for c) Enhance Calling menu.  Jyothna/Ming-Shu, how about your opinions?  
After discussion with [~a12764] and [~wch683] we agreed to move USC 5G plans to 2021 Q1.
After further discussions USC will use R2 as its baseline.  Thus removing the A12 R1 Need label.
After review today with Ajit and Mayank it was concluded that this plan should move to A12 R1 so the 2021Q3 label was removed and the a12r1 label was added.
After review with Mayank and Ajit this can be moved to Q2.


Austin has been ranged by USC and these features are now needed to be included in A12 R1 so adding the A12 R1 Need label.
Config Error is showing, please update the test CWV date as 8/7
Consider Kiev for now
Consider Kiev for now 
During a review of current plan backlogs in preperation for 2021 Q2 RQL it was determined this plan could move to Q3 or beyond.
For a) and b), I am checking with modem team to finalize the design. FW and OMADM all have plan for it.

For c), it is in this plan's scope, i.e. support a dialog to notify the end user.
Hi Chris .. yes thats the story .. 
We cannot test it on Odyssey as well as we are not offering Odyssey to USC .. 
Kiev may be the next product .. 

Hi [~a21143],

This feature seems to be only applicable for USCC.
Hence, no impact on VZW's Advanced Calling setting. CBS/Core Settings team shall handle this requirement.

Reg. the requirement C, as Mingshu has mentioned, the dialog should be displayed. Pls confirm the below requirements -
- I understand the dialog should be displayed even if the currently connected RAN is not 5G and irrespective of the currently set Preferred network type.
- What is the expected behavior when a non-USCC SIM or a SIM without 5G feature is inserted? Is the dialog expected to be still displayed?

Thanks,
Hi [~a21143],  ""Advanced Calling"" setting is applicable only for VZW not for USCC. Hence, it is not right to implement this dialog in VZW's ""Advanced Calling"" setting. Thanks
Hi [~tbagni], Just synced with Chris.
The plan is to have everything done by Apr 30 including test so that we have everything from Q2 in base for Q3 FC on 4/30.

Could you please finish the analysis and commit to this plan considering this date?

Thanks!!
I think it is a dialog pop up when user select turning on ""Enhanced 4G LTE"". 
Per Mayank this won't bee needed for Racer 5G as USC and Tracfone ranging has been removed nor Odyssey.  Removing these labels and moving to Q4 2020 planning.

-----------------
Hi Chris,

I further checked with GTM and they have currently shelved the plan to launch Odyssey BYOD with USC. So in that case lets move the USC features to Q4-2020.

Regards,

Mayank Gupta
Per agreement with [~a12764] and [~wch683] since there is no way to test this right now due to the network not being ready we are moving this feature to Q1.
Per feature review meeting on 8/10 this feature can be moved to A12 R2.

Right now we don't have any Target Product, Waiting for the Target Product & Build to update the Test Dates.
Waiting for the Target/Reference Product to be Identified to validate this Feature.
[~a19035][~wcw014][~a22642] - FYI
[~a19035] Can you confirm that this feature can only be tested on Odyssey?  Seems 5G USC related and my understanding is the only 5G USC product on the roadmap right now is Odyssey...

[~tgb348] FYI
[~a20402], yes.  This is only apply to 5G device, for non 5G device we should keep the same as current implementation.
[~a21143] Are you able to commit to this plan yet?
[~a21143] Charles indicated that both [~a22977] and [~a20402] would have work for this plan.  So I assigned it to Dawny and added Dengfeng as the dev lead.  Wanted you to be in the loop.
[~a21143] when we were reviewing Tom's plans today, Ming-Shu mentioned that a Core Apps plan was needed for settings.  Assigning to you.
[~a21143]/[~wcw014] Our team can take this plan to work on *c)*, but before we can commit to it we need to know what's the due date for Q2

+[~mvt647]
[~a22977] / [~a20402] Have you completed the development for this feature?  The Int CWV date is past due.

[~a21143] / [~tgb348] FYI
[~clao] Pls help answer above question. This is my understanding, pls correct me if it is wrong.

I understand the dialog should be displayed even if the currently connected RAN is not 5G and irrespective of the currently set Preferred network type.
[Mingshu] Yes, it is a common warning to let user know the impact on 5G when user turned on VoLTE

What is the expected behavior when a non-USCC SIM or a SIM without 5G feature is inserted? Is the dialog expected to be still displayed?
[Mingshu] Currently other carriers like VZW, TMO doesn't has this requirement. This feature should be configured for USCC only.

1 issue found: IKSWQ-125083 - com.android.settings App_Crash is observed when trying to switch the orientation mode.

As per [~tbagni], the scope of this feature is to simply display the dialog when user tries to disable VoLTE (Enhanced Calling) while Preferred Network Mode is 5G - which we have done in the above test cases. For the the remaining pending cases we need active USC 5G device and sim.

[~a22642], [~wcw014], Fyi.
[~tgb348] there are no open CRs for this plan.  Please update the Test dates.
[~wcw014] : Requires dependent plan RPADX-4060 to be committed before putting a test date. 
[~tgb348]
[~wcw014] AOSP has this feature in base on Android R.
[~wcw014], I suppose this plan is for *b) Ignore the OMADM value for VoLTE node* in FEATURE-6645.  RPADX-4060 is for *c) Add Pop-up if the user tries to toggle VoLTE off (Enhanced Calling)* in FEATURE-6645. 
[~wcw014], this was already integrated. We need test dates.
[~a22642] - fyi, could you please update the test plan for this feature?
Thanks.
adding [~a19035],
Hi [~w19976],
The pop out is only apply for 5G device, in this case.  yes.
If the non-USCC SIM or without 5G, we should not be displayed for the pop up.

hi [~w19976][~a17364][~dth436] Jyothsna would you include this change as part of 'Advanced Calling' menu customize, to support the custom behavior ""Turning off Enhanced Calling will also turn off 5G mobile data"" ? it can be designed as no dialog by default, and enable the dialog by USCC mnc/mcc.
i think this will be under mobile network settings menu.  +[~tbagni] and [~zhangmp1][~luogang2].  Note USCC is just taking retail build"

Hi [~tgb348],

    DSDS changes of TMO WFC and VZW WFC (for retail devices) have been integrated today. 

Please Note: TMO WFC has a functional dependency on RPADX-4925. Once framework changes are integrated, the features can be verified.

Hi [~w19976],
ImsConfig.ACTION_IMS_CONFIG_CHANGED has been used in VZW MVNO WFC feature as well.
Request you to cover it as part of this plan itself.
Thanks
Hi [~w19976],
Pls pass subId even in ImsConfig.ACTION_IMS_CONFIG_CHANGED intent.
This intent is used for VZW WFC feature.
*Similar to PROVISION_STATE_CHANGED intent I am using the below extra for the subId.*
public static final String EXTRA_SUBSCRIPTION_INDEX = ""android.telephony.extra.SUBSCRIPTION_INDEX"";

1) We are wating the CRs to be integrated (IKSWR-27192, IKSWR-27906, IKSWR-27175) in order to continue tests on Capri (AT&T+TMO sim cards)

2) For combinations between VZW+AT&T and VZW+TMO, we already request an eSIM line active on units that are available to use on Davros Chicago:
DAVROS-8547 and DAVROS-8548. As soon as they have eSIM line activated we'll start the Sanity executions for VZW+ AT&T and VZW+TMO combinations.

[~a17364] I will cover ImsConfig.ACTION_IMS_CONFIG_CHANGED in https://idart.mot.com/browse/RPADX-5162 plan as VZW WFC is required in stock device.
User must always tell which SIM is the default for Voice, SMS and/or Data. 
This is the case whenever there are 2 SIMs inserted, regardless whether from the same carrier or not.
[~a19035], For OMADM NI, we know which SIM this wap push comes from. So we can use that SIM's IMEI to communicate with server. But for CI, which IMEI we should use if both of the SIMs are from the same carrier(ro.carrier)? If only one SIM is from this carrier(ro.carrier), I think we should use this SIM's IMEI.

*Below are the CIs for different carriers:*
1. ATTDM FOTA DM session
2. USCDM CI for every power up.
3. Sprint Update Profile, CIFUMO
4. Boost CIFUMO and UICC unlock
5. Verizon normal CI and checkin DI.

    AT&T's clarification has been requested on the following requirement:

Reference: 18834_UXrequirements_2006 v3
WFC3-B:
When the user activates WFC from Setup & Transfer, the web sheet flow is presented without a
frame (i.e., there is no header bar with a title and cancel button).

[Moto]: How does user activate WFC from Setup & Transfer?
* Will an intent be sent by Setup & Transfer that WFC App needs to handle to present the web sheet flow?
* If yes, pls share the intent details.

WFC web sheet flow can result in (i) Success (ii) In progress or (iii) Error
-- [Moto Proposal] In all the 3 cases, WFC App will display the dialog before returning back to Setup & Transfer flow.
-- However, WFC3-B states: ""If Service Activation is successful, the user is taken back to Setup & Transfer where a success message is displayed""
-- [Moto Proposal] is different from WFC3-B, as the dialog will be displayed by WFC APP before returning back to Setup & Transfer flow


    Please find the below response from AT&T regarding the clarification requested for WFC-3B.

""After chatting further with my team, we found the root problem here.  The updates to the 18384 made the assumption that there is an existing S&T/WFC integration for Motorola devices.  This is not the case.  An existing relationship between the apps is a pre-requisite to WFC3-B.
 I will have to circle back with Cathy to discuss how to handle. ""

Hi [~wcw014]

It is not about missed requirements nor test coverage. I'm sorry but I missed this CR, closing the RPADX without being assure of its criticality based on FEATURE-6855 comments about OS Upgrade restrictions.
Hi [~wcw014],
We found a critical issue (IKSWR-48466) during some BOTA validation for this feature. Could you please reopen this RPADX?
Thank you so much!

There's a dependency on Launcher that's under discussion.
[~rafaelsc] after a plan is completed we don't typically reopen it as the test team can't easily track this.  

I have some quesitons though.  Were these missed requirements or possibly test cases which should have been created but weren't?  I don't undertand how we can pass the test cases to be able to complete the plan and then find a critical issue later.

[~mvt647], [~a22642], [~rafaelsc]
[~wcw014], Launcher team already fixed the dependency. CoreApps patch was integrated on Feb/05/2021.
[~wcw014], the fix for IKSWR-48466 is already integrated.
ok.  Let's go ahead and reopen then.  [~josegsp] please update IKSWR-48466 to working with a target date.

The TMO Config has the following in its xml which is parsed:

I do not get, how we can add these to KEY_5G_ICON_CONFIGURATION_STRING? Could you please help check
The parser is already implemented, need to apply the confiurations.

Just discussed with [~dvw873] and framework will provide apis for 
<IconRefreshDelay_IdletoConnect>30</IconRefreshDelay_IdletoConnect>

FEATURE-6868,,FEATURE-6868: Moto Launcher - Support predefined and user created folders in app tray,"AT&T completed and no bugs pending.
Retail completed and minor issue pending: IKSWR-59575

T-Mobile: Pending with blocker CR IKSWR-59559

MetroPCS: Pending because no HW+ Metro sim card available to test today.
Again if you want to keep this plan open for all channels and variants then we need to keep this open for years together. 
As it is working for ATT and Retail go ahead and close this plan .. there is no action from ADX dev and test anymore and the variant testing is up to GPD team.
Checked that there is another requirement to show ""Moto"" folder in App Tray according to IKSWR-56366. After tested on latest Denver build, it was verified that it's missing ""Interactive wallpaper"" app inside Moto folder. To fix it it's necessary IKSWR-60534 integrated. We checked that its missing ""Target Date"" for integration. 

We'll change ""Test CWV"" date based on this IKSWR-60534.

Hey [~chenchen], The Int CWV for this plan was today but it seems there is still a CR in the new state.  Do you wknow when you will be able to integrate it?  Can you update the CWV date?

[~rafaelsc] FYI
Hey [~chenchen], it looks like all the gerrits for the linked CR have been merged now.  If there is nothing else pending can you mark the ""Integrate Actual"" date?
Hi All,

I am totally confused.
All the changes for Denver ATT for the predefined folder have been verified. 
I have added my comments earlier(12/Mar/21) as well that creating preloaded folder for other channels and other devices is not something which we should worry about. 
This is part of GPD team which they will do and track it eventually. 

Please mark the plan as complete. 

Thanks
Mayank



Hi All,

IMPORTANT: None of R upgrade products received the integration of this implementation IKSWR-49261. 

I tested on Odyssey AT&T latest Mainline build RPS31.112 and this implementation is not there. So, I raised CR IKSWR-58418 with RNI_Blocker label.


Hi [~wcw014],
We will check if IKSWR-58418 is present in mainline builds as commented in the CR. If so, it won't be blocker.
Regarding IKSWR-57190: Dev team was waiting our validation to approve the fix (a test build was provided in the CR comments and we validated). As a result, we found another CR: IKSWR-59559.
Adding [~kaiocmb] and [~kaique] for more information.

Thank you
Hi [~wcw014], I tested the build provided on IKSWR-57190 and there is a blocker issue that I raised: IKSWR-59559. Therefore, not possible to pass the Test cases related to it and we can complete the Plan without this fix.
Hi all!
CM Team told that Denver Mainline builds will not be available anymore, only Q2 builds. We are seeing this Feature already integrated on Q2 for Denver (RRE31.Q2-10).

Hi all,
For ATT, this feature is working fine. For TMO, Metro PCS and Retail we still have these two CRs:

- IKSWR-57245 - [Denver Retail] FEATURE-6868 The Google preloaded folder is not displayed on App Tray for Retail builds
- IKSWR-57190 - [Denver TMO] FEATURE-6868 The Google and T-Mobile folders with PAI and preloaded apps are not displayed in App Tray

Regarding tracking this feature for other carriers, should we close this RPADX by Mayank's comment above? 
[~a22642] [~wcw014] FYI
Is the ATT change working fine, if so we can close the plan, rest all changes will be managed via IKCONFP or JIRA CRs, similar to what we do for Homescreen folders

[~wcw014] FYI

Performed tests for T-Mobile with Q2 build Stable product line: RRE31.Q2-11-15 and the folders are properly displayed on App Tray, except for one specific device on Davros that does not display T-Mobile folder in App Tray. I raised a minor CR to investigate this case: IKSWR-63009.

For MetroPCS we are not able to validate the apps delivered by AS/VPL on Metro by T-Mobile because device under test is not in USA. But, all preloaded apps are displayed properly inside Metro by T-Mobile folder. 

For CoreApps perspective this change of FEATURE-6868 is validated on Retail, AT&T, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile displaying preloaded folders on Homescreen and App Tray according to each carrier specifications/variances.

We are trying to get access on Denver with Metro sim card to validate as well.

Builds tested: RRE31.Q2-11-3  & RRE31.Q2-16

The engineering CR is https://idart.mot.com/browse/IKSWR-13354
This is considered a first priority for 2021 Q1.
This was integrated into Q2 so updateing from a ""Q2 need"" to Q2.
Yes we should have this implemented for TMO USKU as well .. 
And for Retail too 
[~a19035], Tests on AT&T are almost completed, I'm just waiting build to test IKSWR-54944 . Do you have updates about this feature will be integrated for TMO as well?
[~a19035], could you please help to clarify CR IKSWR-15548 about Folder name should be mandatory?  Thanks.
[~a22642], do you agree with that?

[~chenchen] this plan is needed to support IKSWR-49261 which was not understood to be a requirement when this feature was initially implemented.  This is needed for Q2 products but needs to go to mainline and be tested first before [~w15621] will allow it to be cherry picked back to the Q2 branch.  That is why you will notice the plan was opened for Q3 but has the adx_2021q2_need label indicating the need for Q2.
[~rafaelsc], [~a22642], [~brunoess] based on the comments on IKSWR-58418 is that considered a blocker for completing this plan?  It seems that IKSWR-57190 is in the ready state so hopefully once that gets integrated we can finish testing and complete the plan."
FEATURE-6870,,FEATURE-6870: T-Mobile - Carrier Config changes - Q1-2021,"All the requirements are met.
We're just awaiting QC to check if we are going to support the WFC tags.
Following are the new requests as a part of this TRD:
1. Overlay for device group for Metro - change needed
2. New parser for EC/UP - already taken care
3. New parser for VVM user string - this change was done before, but later TMO asked us to remove. Confirmed with [~a20746] and [~a19035] this change will be done for Q1 2021
4. New parser for WFC threshold - if Qualcomm supports this, the change can be implemented. The value is hardcoded and currently there is no way to change it from AP side or even FSG/MBN. Dependency on Qcomm.

{noformat}
From: Karthik K <A20746@motorola.com>
Sent: 24 August 2020 18:40
To: Mahdavifar, Zeinab <Zeinab.Mahdavifar@T-Mobile.com>; Mayank Gupta <mayank@motorola.com>
Subject: RE: [External] NVVM: New Requirements for Coexistence and VM2T
 
Hi Zeinab,
 We have a few proposals regarding Refresh and Co-Existence VVM requirements. Can you please consider the same.

1) GID-MTRREQ-484320: Manual Refresh

  [Motorola 08/24] - Even in case of NW issue causing SMS outage, user's action of navigating to and from ""Voicemail"" tab will be frequent enough to trigger an automatic refresh.
  We feel this automatic refresh should take care of the SMS outage scenario and propose to remove the additional REFRESH option. Please suggest.

2) Reference: ""Native-VVM-Device-ImportNEW.pptx"" Slide #1: ""Device Import  Purpose and Requirements""

  It is mentioned that ""No need to COPY content of files to local memory"" 
  [Moto Proposal]: Import voicemails stored on ""“sdcard/smvvm/backup/files"" into CallLog DB. 

  [Motorola 08/24] –  There is no capacity limit for CallLog database. It should be possible to write to the call log database till sufficient memory is available on the device. The call log database has “Call log” entries (received, outgoing, missed calls) along with the voicemails data.

  Meanwhile sorry for the incorrect update that the voicemail entries in call log database would be migrated. In fact during our tests, it was observed that Google isn’t migrating the voicemails content when user switches from one device to another.

  However we still propose to provide a unified experience to the user by storing the imported voicemails in call log database in a single Inbox view with UI to distinguish the migrated voicemails. Please suggest.

3) GID-MTRREQ-484311: Coexistence with TMO VVM app 

  [Motorola 08/24] –  We shall take care that no duplicate VMs are displayed to the user.
  But as highlighted in (2), migration of voicemails is not supported by Google. Hence we shall not be compliant to the below requirement.
  “GID-MTRREQ-484311- Device shall provide a mechanism to users to migrate VMmessages from older device to new device (if older device supported TMOVVM)”

4) GID-MTRREQ-484311: Coexistence with TMO VVM app 
   - Device shall suppress any other VVM-only client notification. (i.e T-Mobile VVMapp notification shall be suppressed, but DIGITS app VVMnotification shall not(since not a VVM-onlyclient)”

  [Motorola 08/24] – Please confirm if the device has to take care of suppressing the VVM only client notifications or is it taken care as part of the T-Mobile VVM app / Digits app.
  If the device needs to take care of suppressing the VVM only notifications, please inform the mechanism to identify and differentiate between VVM only notifications and DIGITS notification (which is not VVM only client).

Karthik

TMO NVVM Q1 2020 Requirements clarifications summary:
1) *GID-MTRREQ-484320: Manual Refresh*
 -- ""Refresh"" option is made optional and decided not to be implemented.
 -- The required functionality is already being achieved while accessing Voicemail UI.
 
2) *GID-MTRREQ-484311: Coexistence with TMO VVM app*
 -- ""Migration of voicemails from old device to new device"" is not app level requirement (Need not be implemented in Native Dialer as part of TMO Native VVM feature). This depends on device level migration supports ""voicemail migration"" along with call logs.

3) *GID-MTRREQ-484311: Coexistence with TMO VVM app (reference to the doc - ""Native-VVM-Device-ImportNEW.pptx"")*
 -- the voicemails from TMO VVM app (stored in the path /sdcard/smvvm/backup/file) will be copied to call log database, like regular downloaded voicemails.
 -- The restored voicemails shall be shown in the Voicemail Inbox screen along with downloaded voicemails, with a visual identification indicating restored voicemails.
 -- If a restored voicemail is deleted, both of its copies - from call logs and rom external storage path shall be deleted.
 
4) *GID-MTRREQ-484311: Coexistence with TMO VVM app - Notifications*
 -- Device shall take care of suppressing the notifications. The only notifications to suppress is MWI and TMO VVM app.
 -- If the flag ""VVMEnabled"" from TMOConfig is ""TRUE"", then TMO VVM app notifications shall be suppressed by Native VVM. Else Native VVM shall not suppress the TMO VVM app notifications.
 
The implementation of the requirements is ready and pushed to gerrit.

With only TMO carrier test we may not able to complete the feature. 

[~a22642] - FYI


[~wcw014] Do we plan to support single build target in Q2 or Q3? Pls help comment.
yes we would like to get to a single build source for devices with enough storage since there is a cost in having all of the bloatware for each supported carriers presented on the same build.

Currently Burton has less code source branch and a common MSI but each of the product partition are different. Meaning that we do not have a  build that we could be used as is for Vzw, ATT and TMO stock for example. Also CID would be common. So software wise it would be common.
We will discuss the timing and the QSSI targeted product soon.

Hi all,

Updating the Test CWV due to the [CR|https://idart.mot.com/browse/IKSWR-45872] that is still impacting the execution.

Hi all, after the analysis made by the test team, it turns out that:

*SIM requirement:* Live SIM
*Network availability:* Live
*Target Reference hardware:* R NPIs
*Any dependency:* Server - Moto Safe Portal
*Estimated number of TCs:* 34
*Complexity of the Feature Test:* High

*Any pending queries from dev team:*

* Is the only way of locking and unlocking via Server notification? 
* Is there a way of locking/unlocking via commands (for final users)?
* Will Quick Settings (Mobile Data & WiFI) be accessible? 
* Will there be changes in the MotoSafe portal to cover this new feature?
* Any carrier dependency?


On behalf of ADX CESAR Team,
Brunna Arruda.
Integration CWV updated to 01/29 due to several reasons:

1) Code review is taking longer than we expected
2) Server team did not provide a test API so development team can't validate both scenarios (reversible and non-reversible lock)
3) New requirement was requested yesterday, based on dev team analysis it is feasible and should be integrated with the feature

[~caioluiz] and [~wcw014] dev and server team are actively working on these 3 items in order to integrate on 01/29. If we can't make it, we may need a couple more days, but we will still have time for 1 week of testing before Q2 FC (02/12).

[~renano] when testing, please make sure you also test a previous released device since there were changes in the server and we need to make sure that the feature still works fine with the current version of PAKS.

Hi [~dth436] - thanks for the feedback.

CDR-WiFi-1510 and CDR-WiFi-1750  are covered under FEATURE-7039. Modem SMEs are already tagged on it.


The purpose of CDR-WiFi-1404 and WFC14is to offer user choice for WFC options as other carriers have for WFC
- Please elaborate on this, why would the device force to display and set preference per location? 
-- Please share the REQ_IDs for ""As there is only one setting for HOME and ROAMING"" - we can discuss with ATT if these are still needed considering the introductions of CDR-WiFi-1404 and WFC14. 

[~a19035]
Hi [~dth436], [~a20746]

Here's the feedback from ATT SMEs,
-  International roaming is always Wi-Fi preferred, that’s not changing. The new UX only applies to non-international roaming case where use to be cellular preferred, now with this optional UX, the user can select either cellular preferred or wi-fi preferred.
- The next release of 18384 would address this via an update to WFC14 by adding a sub-text. Until then, let's move ahead with a placeholder text to convey _""that this setting applies only in the HOME network and for the INTERNATIONAL network the Wi-Fi Calling would be Wi-Fi Preferred ""_

Let's move ahead with CDR-WiFi-1404 and WFC14 implementation considering the above info. 

[~a19035] [~wcw014]
Hi [~nadeemp]/ [~a19035],

AT&T introduced a New Requirement that requests for WFC Preferenes: Cellular Preferred OR Wi-Fi Preferred.
The related requirements are CDR-WiFi-1404 and WFC14.
Both these requirements are Optional.
Pls confirm if Motorola can decide to DROP these requirements.

*Rationale (to drop):*
Seemingly simple, WFC preferences can be quite confusing to user
* As there is only one setting for HOME and ROAMING
* Device will be forced to display the setting applicable to user's current location
* The settings can display ""Cellular Preferred"" while in HOME network and can display ""Wi-Fi preferred"" while in ROAMing network, even though user did not make any change.

2 other requirements mentioned as part of FEATURE-7045:
CDR-WiFi-1510 and CDR-WiFi-1750 are related to Handover Threshold values
These requirements shall be handled by modem.
Hi [~w19976],

     As requested by Kumar, please inform whether HOME + Domestic roaming shall be considered the same,

     If they are considered as different, kindly confirm whether the below approach can be followed.

 MotoExtTelephonyManager.getServiceStateVoiceRoamingType(ServiceState ss)   -   To detect whether its Home or Domestic or International Voice roaming.

     If Roaming type is  ROAMING_TYPE_DOMESTIC, set the WiFi calling mode using below API.    
ImsMmTelManager.setVoWiFiRoamingModeSetting(int mode)

    Else in all other cases, set the WiFi calling mode using below API  (for Home network).
ImsMmTelManager.setVoWiFiModeSetting(int mode)

    Please confirm.

Note to Test team:

   The AT&T WiFi calling application changes have a dependency on framework CR IKSWR-24169.

    Please verify the feature once IKSWR-24169 is integrated.
Okay, I will use that CR to change the ""editable_wfc_mode_bool"" as TRUE for all ATT and MVNO carriers.

Thanks, [~dth436] for additional info. Following up w ATT SME, will update here soon. 
The following requirements will be handled as part of Plan:
* CDR-WiFi-1404 and WFC14: WFC Preference setting
* <CDR-WiFi-1570> Notification of Wi-Fi Calling capability When Wi-Fi Calling Toggle is Off as the dbm level has been modified for notification also
Note: The dBm level in v20.3 is specified as -114dBm but ATT SME confirmed it should be -108dBm

[~nadeemp]: Pls update FEATURE-7045 with the following info:
<CDR-WiFi-1570> Notification of Wi-Fi Calling capability When Wi-Fi Calling Toggle is Off as the dbm level has been modified for notification also
Note: The dBm level in v20.3 is specified as -114dBm but ATT SME confirmed it should be -108dBm
[~a20746] For ATT's WFC mode editable, there are two parameters in the carrierconfig
editable_wfc_mode_bool, the default value is TRUE
editable_wfc_roaming_mode_bool  the default value is FALSE.
May I understand we need to change editable_wfc_roaming_mode_bool to TRUE for ATT?

Pls see my comments for these requirements

<CDR-WiFi-1510> Thresholds for Handover
Summary: The device shall have the following set of threshold values for handover:
• Tout-ran: RAN signal strength value that a Cellular preferred service or idle mode should handover to Wi-Fi. Recommended value for LTE RAN is -108dBm

Please Note: -114 dBm updated to -108 dBm

[~dth436] The current FW WFC mode default configuration for ATT is as below:
WFC mode in home network - ""Cellular Preferred""
WFC mode in roaming network - ""WiFi Preferred""
WFC mode in home network - ""Not editable""
[~nadeemp] / [~a19035] / [~a20746] / [~w19976]
Refer to:
{code}
<CDR-WiFi-1404> Wi-Fi Calling Service Preference
Summary: The device may provide a setting for the user to choose between cellular
preferred or Wi-Fi preferred. If the setting is provided, the default selection shall be cellular
preferred

<CDR-WiFi-1560> Wi-Fi Preferred for International Roaming
Summary: The device shall set all in scope services to Wi-Fi Preferred while roaming internationally
{code}
As per the above 2 requirements, 
* while in HOME, WFC setting = Cellular preferred
* while roaming internationally, WFC setting = Wi-Fi preferred
These default values are set by FW / Modem and not controlled by App.
[~w19976]: pls confirm

As the default values are different for Home and Roaming and there is only one user facing WFC setting,
* The same setting got to reflect the value based on user current location
* As the default values are different, user would see a different setting based on his location - Home / Roaming

This is the confusion that I referred to in my previous comment.

[~nadeemp]: If this requirement can be dropped for Motorola - then it is fine.

Otherwise, pls request AT&T to clarify:
As per CDR-WiFi-1404 and CDR-WiFi-1560, default Network Preference will be
* Cellular Preferred in HOME network
* Wi-Fi Preferred in International roaming

As there is only one setting: ""Wi-Fi Calling"" -> ""Network preference""
Motorola proposes to use this setting for HOME only
* ""Network preference"" for International roaming shall always remain ""Wi-Fi preferred"" and does not get impacted by the change user makes in ""Wi-Fi Calling"" -> ""Network preference""
Pls confirm

As per confirmation received from AT&T, it is needed to make WFC more editable for AT&T (in HOME)
* Editing is not needed for International Roaming
* As AT&T mentioned that editing of ""WFC Preference"" is not needed for International Roaming, 
** Domestic Roaming shall be treated same as HOME.
[~w19976]: Pls confirm that HOME + Domestic shall be considered the same

1) Make VoLTE setting hidden (hide_enhanced_4g_lte_bool)
2) For any Q->R (Q2 onwards) upgrade case FW should reset VoLTE user value as true. This is to handle the case if user had turned off VoLTE through ""Advanced Calling"" setting.

2>	Could you confirm when the lab for CV will be ready or not? We will assume all the list/periodically CV will get waiver.

I plan to finish the code this week (except the unknown status). And I will merge it to main line and Q2. Could you help to let me know when the App code will be ready?

Hi [~dth436][~a17364][~a24148][~tbdc37][~hrgn76],

1>	The only change is that I will remove the PresencePolling.apk. 
---- Please app team test it by remove it from phone after remount. I am making a build to test it.

2>	“unknown” status
Framework supported it already, app team didn’t use it previously. Please apply it on app code:

2.1>  it is local error if requestAvailability return code is not ResultCode.SUCCESS, treated it as “unknown”.

2.2> IRcsPresenceListener
   onSuccess --- can wait intent for the caps
   onError
          SUBSCRIBE_NOT_FOUND, not RCS capable, VOLTE_DISABLED
           others: ""unknown"" (SUBSCRIBE_FORBIDDEN means 403 which indicate the phone itself had not caps).
           
   onFinish: for capability polling, you can ignore it.

   onTimeout: for capablity polling, you can ignore it or treat it as ""unknown""

2.3> intent ACTION_PRESENCE_CHANGED
please refer RcsPresence.java on how to use it.
 get RcsPresenceInfo by the following statement:
* ArrayList<RcsPresenceInfo> rcsPresenceInfoList = intent.getParcelableArrayListExtra(
*           RcsPresence.EXTRA_PRESENCE_INFO_LIST);
*
RcsPresenceInfo included VOLTE_ENABLED, VOLTE_DISABLED, VOLTE_UNKNOWN. so we supported unknown status already. But app treated VOLTE_UNKNOWN and VOLTE_DISABLED as same previously. App need change it now.

Note: the Availability will not need DB any more. Please remove EAB DB related code. And got information with the above API.

[~w20090]

Commit dates are dates when you commit to do the work.  Sometimes developers want to evaluate the feature before committing and will put a baseline (Bsln) and current working view (CWV) date for when they plan to commit.  The Bsln date should not change but the CWV date could depending on if you are able to actually commit by the date you provide.  Similarly the Int Bsln and the Int CWV dates are the dates for integration.  The Bsln date again shouldn't change but if you are able to pull in or need to move out the current working view date then sometime the CWV date will change.  So I am looking for you to put the Int Bsln and Int CWV dates.  

Chris
[~w20090] 

I updated the Design and Int dates for you.  The design dates aren't often used.  Just if a developer wants to track the time it takes them to design the changes.

2/15 is too late.  2/12 is the FC date for Q2.  That needs to include testing and bug fixes.  If your change can be made today go ahead and put 1/29 for the Int CWV and if you push the changes put 1/29 for the Int Actual.  RPADX-5132 is created to track the App changes.  The test team knows not to test until both have been pushed.

This engineering work CR includes
1. Update the UI as the spec
2. Also provide a provider URI to BoomCloud
        a) Query API : so that BoomCloud can query to check moto audio is enabled or not to show their UI to enable MotoAudio
        b) Update api : so that Boom cloud can disable moto audio

[~a19591], [~a21143]: Please confirm if this is applicable only for Nairobi and Burton MR upgrade?
What about products like Borneo NA, which have AudioFX preloaded and not Waves, are they also expected to update to BoomCloud audio solution via R upgrade?

Yes, Chris, as we don't have a feasible architecture yet, this was the agreement. Thanks.
[~a22642], [~jrdk47], the feature was integrated on Oct 18th, 2021.

Here is the guideline to test the feature via TestDPC: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zYSPMYtTac6zVTHURPLHAZ-K8IlJVsnQG-4T-Jkjncg/edit#] 
[~deborard] : Could you please confirm the updated requirements and also pls share RPADX for postponed requirements. So that we can complete this feature
[~deborard], can you confirm this feature is no longer possible to this quarterly? 
We did not find a solution architecture appropriate to our devices and we need more time to investigate how to implement this feature.
[~mvt647], [~deborard], [~a12764] Are we all in agreement it is ok to move this to A12 R1?

[~rborroz], [~w15621], [~wnm846], [~a22642] FYI
[~rborroz] and [~deborard] : This feature is working fine but we have assumed the following as per [~ghayden] ,
 * If websites were cached and user tried to block the policies, they will not enforced until user clears data and cache of chrome
 * Allow list postponed to next release. Please confirm do we have any new RPADX CR
 * As per requirement document, we need to support wildcard character * but not now. 

Could you please confirm. So that we will update test cases and execute them and complete the feature.
[~wcw014] this feature is no longer for 2021Q3. We are not able to implement it for this timeframe.

Hi [~a19591]

Did we get final conclusion on whether we need to move privacy screen ahead ?
Also in case we want to have OTA screens just after  wifi/data  connected screen, this flow is common for both common and also for Android Enterprise flow. so in case we have change here, then it would be triggered for Android Enterprise flows as well 

Also lets try to lockdown the flow as well to commit the feature ? 
we need the above things to be locked down to have exact dates to commit?

Hi [~vinayb]
Can your team also have a plan created to track this feature? we need this feature for Q3 as marked over here, we need plan to link it for better visibility and tracking for Pdm and test as well.

Hi [~a19591]

Do you have any update from Google on the enterprise flow for the concerns raised earlier? we need to lock the flow to make appropriate changes.

Since the flow is not  locked down, updating the integ date to 05/30 , since we have dependency on OTA team as well (integ date of 05/28)

Hi [~tgb348]

IKSWR-92965  seems to be an issue with bota, and the issue is not reproduced with latest bota being used, since OTA team is not ready with vital update server changes to test it bota package is uploaded as vital update and the same is being tested.

https://idart.mot.com/issues/?filter=217580
Feature is merged on mainline and enabled only on Denver product, however since Denver is building from mr-2021-q2-stable1, it does not have the feature yet. In a normal situation we would push the feature to quarter(or product) branch for testing and bug fix, but as this is coming very late (close to LE entries) we prefer to have it tested before merging into product.

So test team needs to:

1) Flash Denver with tomorrow daily build with latest FW hooks ([~rossanez] could you please confirm next daily has [our tag update|https://gerrit.mot.com/#/c/1914703/] and post the build here?).

2)Sideload [latest APK version from jenkins|https://artifacts.mot.com/artifactory/apps/MotoScreenshotEditor/MOTOSCREENSHOTEDITOR-BR-100210331/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/] (TAG 100210331).

[~a22677], please reach out to [~rossanez] if you have any questions on this setup or about the feature implementation or requirements. In order to have the opportunity to ship it on Denver, we would need to make a go/no-go decision by 04/07, dev team will be following up the tests and prioritizing the issues. If feature is good by then, we can, in conjunction with SPM, update the TAG on Denver to latest version.

OK. 

Hi [~a19035],  

as per https://idart.mot.com/browse/FEATURE-7259. looks we only need https://idart.mot.com/browse/IKSWR-78445?

If that is the case then we had done it already. https://idart.mot.com/browse/IKSWR-78445 had been closed already.

Thanks
Gao, Bing

FEATURE-7259:T-Mobile - RCS UP1.0 & UP2.0  - Q4-2021 changes on Release:
RPADX-5277:ADX S_Rel1
We run an RCS Sanity last week on the ST v21 and it passed 100%, so none of the changes from this feature impact on current behavior. The Kaiju report is https://kaiju.motorola.com/#/dalekReports/savedDalekReport/6692619941052416

We are waiting for the feedback from [~kgh367] to check if they tested the mentioned requirements.

+[~brunoess], [~a22642], [~wcw014]
[~w20090] if the work is done can you commit to this plan and mark it as integrated so the test team knows it is ready to be tested?

[~fgcp188], [~a19035], [~malaguti], [~brunoess], [~a22642] FYI
[~w20090] please ask [~a19035] to get delta requirement change list. If the change is minor, please do not use new work to ask ST, we can use defect CR to ask ST implement it.
[~w20090] you had several process issues with this CR.  If you watched the upper platform training video I would hope you would have understood these.
 # You should not complete a plan.  The test team should do that.
 # When you integrate your changes you should mark the integrate actual date and populate the configuration developed field.
 # When you committed to the plan you should have populated the Commit dates (Bsln, CWV, and Actual).

I have tried to fix these for you.  I reopened the plan.  I populated the commit dates based on the CR transition.  I populated the integrate actual date based on your comment that you merged on 9/18.  And I updated the configuration developed to be ro.carrier based on that was the requested configuration.  If any of these values are incorrect then please update them.

[~malaguti], [~brunoess] I believe these are ready for you to test.

[~aquino]  As Rodrigo is on vacation. Could you please clarify the following questions related to this feature.
 # Req document shows there are 2 Options. Which Options we are implementing?
 # If device having only 1 sim, this policy should not work. SIM slot should be always enabled irrespective of the settings
 # If device supports 1 physical SIM and 1 eSIM, will this policy works ? If so, will it be same way as 2SIM slots. Odyssey supports 1 eSIM and 1pSIM which is targetted for A12R2 
 # Odyssey also supports eSIM and pSIM switch, if this policy implemented, what will be behavior on this feature [ FEATURE-6540:
[Odyssey Launch] Single SIM - eSIM or pSIM user switchable solution] 
[~jrdk47],

About the first two questions:
 # The first option has been implemented. Scenarios where the policy is applied: if the slot 1 is empty and the slot 2 is not empty, the policy should not work; if both slots are not empty; the policy should work, disabling the slot 2.
 # If the device has only one slot, the policy should not work.

On the following link, there is details about the tests done during the development of this feature: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WPqD4uy8X0tX0DM2DfZEdxyNcN-r4XitqDsGad-SbCk/view#gid=1981105755]



[~jrdk47], [~deborard],

About the last two questions related to eSIM, I don´t know how the policy should work.


 [~dajlopes] is the tech lead responsible for the development of this feature (he will be back to office January, 18th).
The team members that developed this feature will return to office January, 3rd.
[~rborroz] Is this feature already integrated? 

As per requirement document, there were 2 options present to implement. Which Option we have implemented? Also I saw there were multiple linked CR still open under story IKSWSRVC-25636
